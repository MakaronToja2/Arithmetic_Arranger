# Arithmetic_Arranger

It's my version of arthimetic aranger made as FreeCodeCamp assement.\
I used regular expression to check if problems contains digits of if the operator is + or - \
Then as you can see I splited each problem so I can get every problem seperatly and work on it\
Then made calculations with + or -\
Then set up the spaces between calculations (a lot of work to figure it out)\
And tweaks to set it up in right place and to check everything.
